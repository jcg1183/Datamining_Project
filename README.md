In this data mining project, we implement three clustering algorithms and benchmark their performance against existing programming libraries.

## Algorithms

We chose to implement the K-Means, PAM/K-Medoid, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.

## Datasets

We are utilizing sciki-learn.datasets and Numpy for dataset generation, the project additionally can take in user-provided datasets

## Our Implementation

The clusters.py script will call each algorithm and provide a results file with output from the algorithm and performance metrics.
