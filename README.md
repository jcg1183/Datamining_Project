In this data mining project, we implement three clustering algorithms and benchmark their performance against existing programming libraries.

## Algorithms

We chose to implement the K-Means, PAM/K-Medoid, and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.

## Datasets

We are currently looking for viable datasets to use for our project. At the moment, we are utilizing sklearn and numpy for dataset generation.

## Our Libraries

Each algorithm will be packaged as its own library and will come with a preprocessing script that will convert a csv file into the appropriate format for the algorithm.  Look in each library folder for a readme specific to that library.

The run_project.py script will call each algorithm and provide a results file with output from the algorithm and performance metrics.
